A variable is a way for the scripter to name a piece of data. The name can be anything and can help the scripter to remember the name of a specific part of their code.
Like how we named a variable Health in class when working in Unity
Such as the different names we gave each piece of code in Visual Studio Code when we were first learning classes (mammal, human, bird, etc.)
When we set an object to be named PowerUp in Visual Studio Code in order to allow that object to give the player object a healing boost
The player object was given the name Player and it also had it's own section of code
When we created the health code and assigned it to have 100 or 200
